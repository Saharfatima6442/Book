## Implementation Approach
1. Research and gather information on Physical AI fundamentals
2. Create detailed outline based on the structure above
3. Draft the content section by section
4. Develop relevant Python code examples
5. Integrate content with existing book structure
6. Review for technical accuracy and readability
7. Test code examples to ensure they work as expected

## Dependencies
- Access to research papers and resources on Physical AI
- Understanding of existing book structure and formatting
- Python programming knowledge for examples
- Docusaurus documentation experience for integration

## Risk Mitigation
- Validate all code examples
- Ensure consistent terminology with other chapters
- Cross-reference related concepts in other chapters
- Preserve existing navigation structure
