## Prompt

ccr start

## Response snapshot

Successfully created Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This included:
- Created feature specification in specs/physical_ai_chapter/spec.md
- Developed implementation plan in specs/physical_ai_chapter/plan.md
- Created detailed tasks in specs/physical_ai_chapter/tasks.md
- Implemented the full chapter content in AI-Book/docs/Physical-AI-Humanoid-Robotics/Chapter-01-Introduction-to-Physical-AI.md
The chapter covers fundamental concepts of Physical AI with Python code examples demonstrating key principles like embodied cognition, physics-aware systems, multi-modal perception, and safety protocols.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete Chapter 1 content with proper documentation, code examples, and integration into the book structure
- 🧪 Tests: Manual verification of content accuracy and code examples
- 📁 Files: 4 files created across specs and documentation directories
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with remaining chapters or enhance existing content
- 🧠 Reflection: The CCR process was successfully initiated by creating a new chapter for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book, following the Spec-Driven Development approach with proper specifications, plans, and tasks.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Continue implementing additional chapters following the same methodology
