# AI Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Educational Excellence
Content must be technically accurate, pedagogically sound, and accessible to the intended audience. All concepts should be explained with appropriate depth for readers with intermediate knowledge of AI and robotics.

### II. Documentation Standards
Every concept, code example, and technique must be well-documented with practical examples that readers can understand and implement. Maintain consistent formatting and terminology throughout the book.

### III. Code Quality (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code examples must be functional, well-commented, and represent industry best practices. Each code snippet should be tested for correctness and educational value.

### IV. Modular Content Organization
Chapters and sections should be organized in a logical progression that builds upon previous concepts, while allowing for independent reading of individual sections where appropriate.

### V. Technical Accuracy
All technical claims and explanations must be verified against authoritative sources. When presenting algorithms or techniques, cite original papers and established references.

### VI. Accessibility and Inclusivity
Content should be accessible to readers from diverse backgrounds. Avoid jargon without explanation and ensure examples are culturally neutral.

## Additional Constraints

Technology Stack: Docusaurus-based documentation, Markdown formatting, Python code examples, JavaScript where relevant for web components.
Review Process: All content additions must undergo peer review focusing on technical accuracy and educational effectiveness.
Testing: Code examples must be validated against actual implementations where possible.

## Development Workflow

Content creation follows the Spec-Driven Development approach with specifications, plans, and tasks documented in the .specify directory. All changes must reference specific tasks or user stories.

## Governance

This constitution governs all content and technical decisions for the AI book project. All contributors must follow these principles when authoring content or making technical decisions.
